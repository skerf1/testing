just figuring out how this works while also procrastination on doing the first programming assignment.

//im gonna make a simple program to remind myself how to do absolutely anything

import java.util.Scanner;

class Dax {
public static void main(String[] args){

Scanner input= new Scanner (System.in);
System.out.println("What is your name??");
String name= input.next();
System.out.println("Nice to meet you, "+name+". My name is FateBot. Your future is in my hands now");
